# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a lightweight, enterprise-ready multi-user web application that enables each user to register and authenticate using their individual Jira PAT tokens, then configure their own Company LLM, Jira MCP (Data Center), and Confluence MCP integrations to use an AI-powered iterative workflow to generate, refine, and create Jira stories/tasks/sub-tasks. Each user maintains their own separate credentials, configurations, and data isolation. The system uses FastAPI with server-rendered templates, TailwindCSS, HTMX, Alpine.js, LangChain-based agents, mcp-atlassian, session-based authentication with JWT tokens, and includes comprehensive observability and caching mechanisms.
